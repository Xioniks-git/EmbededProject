### Executive Summary

This report documents the development of a real-time audio classification system using an ESP32-S3 microcontroller with TensorFlow Lite. The project aimed to create an embedded system capable of recognizing three distinct sound classes: glass breaking, door opening, and floor creaking. Through iterative development, we successfully implemented a working system that captures audio via a built-in PDM microphone, processes it through mel-spectrogram conversion, and performs inference using a quantized neural network model.

Key achievements include successful hardware integration, model conversion optimization, and comprehensive debugging infrastructure. The system currently operates with real-time audio processing capabilities, though classification accuracy requires further refinement.

### 3. Implementation Methodology

#### 3.1 Development Environment Setup
Initial setup involved configuring PlatformIO with the ESP32 framework and TensorFlow Lite dependencies. Key configurations included:

```ini
[env:seeed_xiao_esp32s3]
platform = espressif32
board = seeed_xiao_esp32s3
framework = arduino
lib_deps = 
    https://github.com/espressif/tflite-micro-esp-examples
build_flags = 
    -DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM
    -DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1
```

#### 3.2 Model Development Pipeline
The machine learning pipeline consisted of:

1. **Original Model Analysis**: Started with a Keras H5 model (2.9MB)
2. **Model Conversion**: TensorFlow Lite conversion with quantization
3. **Header Generation**: Conversion to C++ header format for embedding
4. **Integration Testing**: Validation on target hardware

#### 3.3 Audio Processing Implementation

```cpp
void audioToMelSpectrogram(float* audio, float* spectrogram) {
    float fft_buffer[FFT_SIZE];
    float mel_energies[NUM_MELS];
    
    for (int frame = 0; frame < NUM_FRAMES; frame++) {
        // Windowing and FFT processing
        applyHannWindow(fft_buffer, FFT_SIZE);
        computeFFT(fft_buffer, FFT_SIZE);
        computeMelFilterbank(fft_buffer, mel_energies);
        
        // Feature storage
        for (int mel = 0; mel < NUM_MELS; mel++) {
            spectrogram[mel * NUM_FRAMES + frame] = mel_energies[mel];
        }
    }
    normalizeSpectrogram(spectrogram, NUM_MELS * NUM_FRAMES);
}
```

### 4. Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### 4.1 Model Quantization Issues

**Challenge**: Initial int8 quantized models produced runtime errors:
```
input->type == kTfLiteInt8 || input->type == kTfLiteInt16" not true
```

**Root Cause Analysis**: The issue stemmed from complex quantization parameter extraction and potential mismatches between model expectations and runtime tensor types.

**Solution**: Implemented a float32-input model pipeline:
- Removed input quantization while maintaining weight quantization
- Simplified data flow by eliminating quantization/dequantization steps
- Reduced numerical precision errors

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Model conversion with hybrid quantization
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
converter.representative_dataset = representative_dataset_gen
# Keeping inputs/outputs as float32, quantizing only weights
```

#### 4.2 Memory Management Optimization

**Challenge**: Limited SRAM (512KB) with competing demands from TensorFlow arena, audio buffers, and system overhead.

**Solution**: Strategic memory allocation using PSRAM:
```cpp
constexpr int kTensorArenaSize = 200 * 1024;  // 200KB in PSRAM
uint8_t* tensor_arena = (uint8_t*)ps_malloc(kTensorArenaSize);
```

**Optimization Techniques**:
- PSRAM utilization for large tensor arena
- Efficient buffer sizing for I2S operations
- Memory fragmentation prevention through static allocation

#### 4.3 I2S/PDM Configuration Challenges

**Challenge**: Inconsistent audio data capture resulting in static or repetitive readings.

**Investigation Process**:
1. **Hardware Verification**: Confirmed XIAO ESP32S3 PDM microphone presence
2. **Configuration Testing**: Experimented with various I2S parameters
3. **Signal Analysis**: Implemented comprehensive audio diagnostics

**Solution**: Optimized I2S configuration:
```cpp
const i2s_config_t i2s_config = {
    .mode = (i2s_mode_t)(I2S_MODE_MASTER | I2S_MODE_RX | I2S_MODE_PDM),
    .sample_rate = 16000,
    .bits_per_sample = I2S_BITS_PER_SAMPLE_16BIT,
    .channel_format = I2S_CHANNEL_FMT_ONLY_LEFT,
    .dma_buf_count = 4,      // Reduced from 8
    .dma_buf_len = 256,      // Increased from 64
};
```

#### 4.4 Model Dimension Mismatch

**Challenge**: Original model expected different input dimensions than initially configured.

**Resolution Process**:
1. **Model Introspection**: Used Netron to analyze actual model architecture
2. **Dimension Mapping**: Identified correct input shape (1, 40, 49, 1)
3. **Code Adaptation**: Updated SPECTROGRAM_SIZE and NUM_FRAMES accordingly

### 5. Testing & Validation

#### 5.1 Diagnostic Infrastructure Development
Implemented comprehensive testing framework:

```cpp
// Audio signal validation
bool data_varies = (max_sample != min_sample) && (non_zero_count > BUFFER_SIZE / 10);
if (!data_varies) {
    Serial.println("⚠️  PROBLEM: Audio data is static or absent!");
    return;
}

// Spectrogram analysis  
float spec_avg = spec_sum / SPECTROGRAM_SIZE;
Serial.print("Significant values: "); Serial.print(non_zero_spec);
Serial.print(" out of "); Serial.println(SPECTROGRAM_SIZE);
```

#### 5.2 Performance Metrics
- **Memory Usage**: RAM: 25.2% (82,412/327,680 bytes), Flash: 23.4% (781,577/3,342,336 bytes)

- Sound input: Door opening → Classification: Glass breaking (high confidence)
- This indicates feature extraction works but model training may be insufficient
